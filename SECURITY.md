* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We believe that coordinated vulnerability disclosure is the right approach to better protect users. We encourage security researchers to report vulnerabilities to us first before disclosing them publicly.

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
* Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
* Do not access a system or account beyond what is necessary to demonstrate a security vulnerability
* Report vulnerability information to us as soon as possible
* Do not disclose the vulnerability to others until it has been resolved

## Recognition

We appreciate the security community's efforts to improve the security of ISP Framework. Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

* Acknowledged in our security advisories (if desired)
* Listed in our Hall of Fame (with permission)
* Eligible for our bug bounty program (when available)

Thank you for helping keep ISP Framework and our users safe!
