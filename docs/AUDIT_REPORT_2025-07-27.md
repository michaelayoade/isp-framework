# ISP Framework – Formal Audit Report

_Date: 2025-07-27_

## 1  Executive Summary
The ISP Framework has grown into a comprehensive platform covering customer management, service provisioning, network/IPAM, authentication (Portal ID & RADIUS), communications, file storage, and an extensible plugin system. Most foundational modules are **production-ready**, but several cross-cutting concerns and integration points still require attention before the system can be considered feature-complete and enterprise-grade.  
This report summarizes the audit findings, identifies functional and business gaps, evaluates risk, and proposes actionable recommendations.

## 2  Audit Scope & Methodology
* **Scope** – Entire backend codebase, database schema & migrations, Docker orchestration, documented requirements, and user-supplied vision documents up to 2025-07-27.  
* **Methodology** – Static code review, schema/contract comparison, migration verification, manual API testing (cURL & Swagger), integration tests (FreeRADIUS, MinIO), and review of project documentation.

## 3  Key Findings
| # | Area | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Portal ID System | ✅ Implemented & migrated | Uniqueness constraints, prefix config, history tracking completed. |
| 2 | Service Management (Internet/Voice/Bundle/Recurring, Tariffs) | 🟡 **Implemented, pending deep integration tests** | CRUD + provisioning logic present; requires full E2E tests with billing & RADIUS. |
| 3 | Network / IPAM | ✅ Models, schemas, endpoints & migrations complete | Minor SQLAlchemy “overlaps” warnings remain (non-blocking). |
| 4 | RADIUS Session Management | 🟡 Partially validated | Auth works with FreeRADIUS; accounting/session records depend on finalized service tables & billing. |
| 5 | Billing Engine | 🔴 **Not implemented** | Documented but no code; critical for production. |
| 6 | Communications Module (Email/SMS) | ✅ Complete & plugin-ready | Requires SMTP/SMS gateway credentials and load tests. |
| 7 | Plugin System | ✅ Dynamic loading, registry, example plugin provided | Authentication flow fixed; further security hardening advised. |
| 8 | File Storage (MinIO) | ✅ CRUD, import/export jobs, 100 MB limit | Docker-compose consolidated; validation script passes. |
| 9 | API Management Keys / Versions | 🟡 FKs resolved but **api_versions** table missing | Blocks key endpoints; low effort fix. |
|10 | SQLAlchemy Relationships | ✅ Blocking errors resolved | Non-blocking warnings logged; monitor. |
|11 | CI/CD & Docker Builds | 🔴 Absent / manual | Missing automated build/test pipeline caused stale dependencies (e.g. `pyotp`). |
|12 | Test Coverage | 🟡 Unit tests light; integration scripts manual | Need automated coverage & regression suite. |
|13 | Documentation | 🟡 Extensive but fragmented | Multiple guides; consolidate & keep versioned. |

## 4  Risk Assessment
1. **Billing Engine absence (High)** – Revenue blocking; delays Go-Live.  
2. **Manual build/deploy (High)** – Inconsistent environments; hidden dependency drifts.  
3. **Partial integration testing (Medium)** – Potential runtime failures across modules.  
4. **Auth/Billing coupling (Medium)** – RADIUS relies on service & billing status; ensure atomicity.  
5. **Security review pending (Medium)** – No penetration or vulnerability scans run yet.  
6. **Non-blocking relationship warnings (Low)** – Could surface as edge-case bugs.

## 5  Recommendations (Road-map)
Priority legend: **P1 = critical**, P2 = important, P3 = nice-to-have

### P1 – Critical (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Implement Billing Engine** (models, rating, invoicing, payments, dunning).  
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** – GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for lint, tests, Docker build, Alembic migration verification.  
3. **Automated End-to-End Tests** – Customer → Service → Portal ID → RADIUS-Auth → Billing flow.

### P2 – Important (Next 4 weeks)
4. Finish **RADIUS accounting/session** linkage with service & billing status.  
5. Resolve **`api_versions`** table & any pending FK placeholders.  
6. Add **performance/load tests** for high-traffic modules (auth, billing, file uploads).  
7. **Security Hardening** – OWASP Top-10 audit, JWT expiry/refresh, rate-limiting, secrets management.

### P3 – Nice-to-Have (Quarter)
8. Complete **documentation consolidation** under `docs/` with versioned changelog.  
9. Automate **Docker Compose → Kubernetes** helm charts for staging/prod.  
10. Address remaining SQLAlchemy “overlaps” warnings; adopt strict linting.

## 6  Conclusion
The ISP Framework is **70-75 % feature-complete**. Foundational modules are implemented and largely production-ready, but mission-critical components—most notably Billing and rigorous automation (CI/CD, testing)—must be prioritized to achieve a fully operational release.

Timely execution of the P1 recommendations will mitigate high risks, unlock revenue functionality, and pave the way for robust integrations (RADIUS, plugins, communications). Subsequent P2/P3 tasks will enhance scalability, security, and maintainability.
