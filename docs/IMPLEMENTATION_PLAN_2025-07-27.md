- **QA Engineer:** 1 full-time (for testing automation)
- **Security Consultant:** 1 part-time (for security audit)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Billing complexity** - Start with MVP billing, iterate based on feedback
2. **Integration dependencies** - Use feature flags to decouple releases
3. **Testing reliability** - Invest in stable test infrastructure early
4. **Resource constraints** - Prioritize P1 items, defer P3 if needed
